Title: Separating Hues
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
This project started more as an attempt to learn, and implement a machine learning algorithm - specifically a K-Means analysis. Within this project are two attempts at playing with color. The first is a simple program that graphs the values of various pixels from an image in a 3-Dimensional space; the program then creates an animation of that 3D space. The second, is a program that implements a K-Means algorithm on the same image, iterating through K= 1 to 100, and creating an animation of the change.  
 

Note:
This was a first attempt at exploring color, machine learning, and change. The biggest limitation with this project is needed processing power, and memory. In both cases, hard barriers were met which significantly hampered progress.
